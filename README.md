# likelihood-of-working-classification

The goal of this project is to build a model to predict likelihood of working in a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) career based on basic demographics: Age, sex, race, state of origin.
Before building the classifier, we visualized and presented the data to gain a better understanding of it.

The inspiration for this project comes from a series of 2011 reports by the US Department of Commerce, showing that women and racial minorities are underrpresented in stem fields in two ways: They represent a disproportionatly small percentage of STEM degree holders, as well as STEM workers. These reports are linked below:

"Women in STEM: A Gender Gap to Innovation"
"Education Supports Racial and Ethnic Equality in STEM"

In order to quantify these differences and compare the effects of individual demographic predictors, we've created a nueral network model. 

With this model, we provide a high level overview of which demographic features are most likely to influence disparities at the level of education, and which are most likely to influence disparities at the level of hiring.
